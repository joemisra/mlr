mods by joseph melnyk (jmelnyk@batterycollection.net) 11.03.07:
- next tempo can be set with floating point values (also saved to presets
  as such)
- microfades between button presses (less clicking then)
- tempo is auto-loaded from prefixes
- extra quantize resolution of 1/2 (every other hole note)
- slots to save session locations (hard-wired) for quicker loading
- 8 channels instead of 4
- 4 pattern recorders instead of 2; located at 8-11 of row 0
- mod buttons no longer present to adjust volume during default
  remix mode (but see below)
- buttons 12,0 and 13,0 go backwards/forwards thru presets, respectively
- channels 7 and 8 are panned hard left and right, respectively
- keystrokes 8, 9 and 0 change the buffer recording resolution to 16, 32
  and 64 steps (respectively)
- row reset option allows you to choose which row to reset, in case one
  of them becomes frozen;  simply choose the row from the drop down
  and it will be reset and then usable again
- keystroke 'i' toggles input buffer recording mode
- click output (impulse) goes to audio outputs 3/4 when toggled on
- all output goes to headphones (audio output 3/4) always
- pressing mod button 15 in row 0 toggles a mod page with the following options:
   a) row 0, columns 0-7 toggle mute for the eight channels; changes to the
      interface with the mouse are also reflected back here
   b) rows 15-1, columns 0-7 (just below the channel mutes) display the
      current volume fader setting for that channel; pressing 15th row
      button on each of these columns will decrease the volume for
      that channel, pressing 1st row button will increase it
   c) rows 1-5, column 10 are assigned to quantize changing; hitting one will
      change the quantize to 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4 or 1/2, respectively; changes
      in the interface with the mouse are also reflected back here
   d) rows 1-8, column 11 are assigned to session locations 1-8 (if present);
      hitting one will load the selected session
   e) rows 1-8, column 12 are assigned to input buffers 1-8; hitting
      one will set up the selected buffer and fire it for recording
      (quantized, as before);  it will then set up the same numbered track
      for playback of that buffer number, change back to the default
      "remix" page, then playback the buffer as soon as its done recording
      (quantized);  this option makes it a lot easier to record and
      playback loops on the fly
   f) column 13, rows 1-15 are assigned to half-timing tracks 1-15 while
      column 14, rows 1-15 are assigned to double-timing them;  when
      the timing is less than 1 the led in column 13 is lit, if its
      greater than 1 the led in column 14 is lit, otherwise neither
      is lit (i.e. during normal playback)
   g) column 15, rows 1-15 are assigned to reversing tracks 1-15

known issues:
- if a track's timing is almost, but not exactly equal to one (say 1.000001),
  then the led in column 6 (indicating greater than one) will be lit
- fifteenth row (track) seems to not want to save to presets, etc.



mlr 2.0 documentationbrian crabtree >> tehn@monome.orgfor additional help, read, then post at http://forum.monome.orgdescription:mlr is a live sample-cutting platform. sound files are mapped across a row of the 40h interface, where playback position is indicated by a lit pad. pressing a pad within a row jumps playback to this position. jumps are quantized according to a specified grain. sample playback speed is mapped to a global tempo. multiple "groups" of sounds can play at once, enabling the user to have certain sounds cancel each other (like mute groups in a traditional sampler). each group has its own level, mute and meter. a pattern recording module allows for recording and playback of key sequences. a live input module allows clips to be captured in real time and immediately mapped to a row. there are other subtleties which are explained below.operation:must be run concurrently with either 40h_serial.mxb or 40h_osc_osx.mxb (with serialio) from the 40h_base collection.max/msp must have the OSC objects installed. see the 40h setup docs on http://wiki.monome.orgmlr should run fine in max/msp runtime.quick start:- drag and drop audio files from the finder/explorer onto the "audio file drop" box on the upper right- select an audio file from the leftmost dropdown on the top row (this chooses which sound file for the row)- push up the volume for group 1 (the leftmost slider, in the group of four on the right. the slider is above the mute)- push up the master volume (the leftmost slider on the group of two on the left) and turn on the DAC (this starts audio)- press the first key in the second row on the 40h. this starts the sample playing from the beginning- try pressing different keys in the same row. there it is.details:row and group configuration:- each row gets assigned a file- the 16 boxes indicate the playback length of the sample (on the bottom, change by clicking) and the sample playback position (orange on the top)- the "octave" is the playback speed transposition. use the + and - boxes to change the octave. increasing the octave by one will double the speed. the "speed" box will show you the playback rate *relative* to the original playback speed (according to the sample length). you can manually click and drag the "speed" to specify a different speed, which will decouple the row from the set tempo. when using the speed determined by octave, the playback speed follows the tempo.- "rev" will playback in reverse. tricky.- "group" will choose which voice to use for playback. only one sample can be played at a time per group. samples in the same group cancel one another.- group volumes, mutes, and meters are below on the right. the big grey boxes are sliders, click/drag to change. group is muted when "mute" is orange.timing and tempo:- set tempo by clicking and dragging the "tempo" box. you can also click then type in a value, follow by [enter].- "sub" is the subdivision. something like beats per bar, but perhaps convoluted. we'll consider this a bit more.- "adjust" adds/subtracts values to the tempo. useful for doing incremental tempo modulations.- "nudge" will momentarily change the tempo then bring it back. perhaps helpful for syncing to an external source.- "tap" indicates the pulse. you can also click it to establish a tempo over time.- "quantize" is a dropdown to select the quantize rate for key input on the 40h. try different values and see how the response changes on the 40h.- "next tempo" allows you to specify a new tempo, then hit "set" which will set it as the current tempo. this value is saved in presets (read on.)presets:- a preset saves the row configuration. this way you can arrange sets of sounds, store them, then recall different arrangements later.- << and >> change which preset "slot" you're using. you can then "store" the current setup on this slot. you will be prompted to name the preset. when you save a preset you'll notice that just below "current: ...." will show that you're on a saved preset.- clicking "recall > ..." will recall a stored preset.- < and > move to the next/previous preset *and* recall that preset automatically. so, by clicking > several times, you step through the past saved presets.- clicking the preset number or "current..." do nothing. yep.patterns:- there are two pattern recorders. a pattern records the 40h key input of a certain length, then loops it.- first set the length of the pattern record with the "length" dropdown- push the 5th key from the left on the top row of the 40h, which queues recording.- recording will begin with the first key input on the rows. when recording, you will see the bar scrolling, indicating the record position. this also indicates playback.- the 5th key will flash when the pattern is outputting a recorded key press.- turn off the pattern by toggling the 5th key off.- this is the same for the 6th key also, so you have two pattern recorders to use.- patterns are erased when you turn them off.live input:- audio can be recorded into audio buffers named input1-8 on the file dropdown.- adjust the input volume, which is next to the master volume. press "thru" to pass the input to the output (if needed)- set which buffer to record to by setting the "input" dropdown on the bottom right- set the "legth" of the recording (in beats)- press "go!" and make some noise. the waveform will be updated in real time.- this audio can be used on a row, or on multiple rows, the same as a dropped file.- "loop" sets recording in loop mode, which will continually overwrite itself.  toggle "loop" off to stopoptions:- file saving: click "SAVE" to save your preset and file list. this creates two files. you can later "LOAD" your setup back in (select the file without the _flist)- output audio recorder records what you hear in the speakers to an audio file. that's it.- beat clock source and output for syncing.- dsp options lets you configure your sound card and various performance options for max/msp- midi lets you specify external midi control for group fader levels and assign note-on values to some different key functions40h top row controls:1-4	stop playback for groups 1-45-6	start/stop pattern record7-8	modifier 1 and 21-4 (with mod 1 held)	decrease volume for group 1-41-4 (with mod 2 held)	increase volume for group 1-41-4 (with both mods held)	mute/unmute group 1-4


loop-set mode:

in the bottom seven rows, you can press and hold a start point and then press an end point, then release both. this will create a looping region, which will be deactivated upon the next press in that row.
keyboard shortcuts:space		start/stop everything[ ]		previous/next presetenter		start live recording (same as go!)\		tap.		select next input,		select previous input(we'll add more if you ask nicely)
